# expyriment_psychology_experimets
A couple of experiments using expyriment. 

These are more for demonstration purposes than research purposes. 

### Requires: 

Expyriment (http://www.expyriment.org/ - python3 version: https://github.com/expyriment/expyriment/tree/python3)
Python3.x (2.7 should be fine, see below) 
Pandas 
Matplotlib

Recommend to install python via anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

*Note that I have written these in python3 and (at least when I installed expyriment, the python3 was on a developers branch. So this may get tricky. But they *should* work for python2 and let me know if something doesn't work).* 


### How to use: 
Download/clone. Navigate to specific experiment directory (e.g. visual search). To run, in terminal (OSX/Linux - not sure how you do this in window) type: python visualsearch.py 

### I want to edit these experiments, what do I do? 
Open up visualsearch.py or attentionalblink.py and edit the files there. I will comment these with time and add more structure. If something is confusing, let me know via the issues here.
