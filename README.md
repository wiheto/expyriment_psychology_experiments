# expyriment_psychology_experiments
A couple of experiments using expyriment. 

These are more for demonstration purposes than research purposes. 

### Requires: 

- Expyriment (http://www.expyriment.org/ - python3 version: https://github.com/expyriment/expyriment/tree/python3)
- Python3.x (2.7 should be fine, see below) 
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- numpy

Recommend to install python via anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads - then you get pandas and matplotlib installed as well)

*Note that I have written these in python3 and (at least when I installed expyriment, the python3 was on a developers branch. So this may get tricky. But they *should* work for python2 and let me know if something doesn't work).* 


### How to use: 

Step 1: 
Download/clone the files here. 

Step 2: 
Make sure you download everything in "requires"

Step 3: 
Navigate to specific experiment directory (e.g. visualsearch). 

Step 4:
To run, in terminal (OSX/Linux) type: `python visualsearch.py` 

(For windows and graphically in OSX/Linux run visualsearch.py as program (I think))

### I want to edit these experiments, what do I do? 
Open up visualsearch.py or attentionalblink.py and edit the files there. I will comment these with time and add more structure. If something is confusing, let me know via the issues here.
